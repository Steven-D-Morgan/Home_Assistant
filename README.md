Welcome to my Home Assistant Repository!
======

I quit updating my original Home Assistant configuration repo about a year ago when my spare time began to shrink. I hope this is of use to those of you who are just starting out, looking for a reference or just browsing other peoples setups. I have really simplified my approach to this amazing limitless open-source software. I will update this and give a more detailed README in the very near future. 

Thank you for reading!
